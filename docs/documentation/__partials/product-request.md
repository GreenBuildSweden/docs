If your manufacturing process involves ordering components from one or more suppliers, you can invite them to Eando X, and request them to create the components you use.

This has multiple benefits:

- You can get accurate LCU's without needing to ask the suppliers for data on their manufacturing process.
- You can ensure that the components manufacturing data is correct and up to date.
- Over time, any changes to the suppliers' manufacturing data will be automatically reflected in your products. This eliminates the need for manual updates or frequent follow-ups.

## Factory properties and comparisons

This panel shows the properties of the selected factory. Some of the fields are read-only, and some are editable.

:::warning The data is scoped
The editable fields are **not** global, and will only saved for this product. This allows you to use the same factory in multiple entities, but have its impact be tracked based on the relevant manufacturing process.
:::

## Fields

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Division | How much of the product that was produced in this factory. |
| Location | Where the factory is located. |
| GWP total | The total global warming potential generated by the factory during the manufacturing of a single product. |

## Impact graph

At the bottom of the panel, you will see an environmental impact graph for the factory. This graph is interactive, and can show data for multiple different impact categories.

## Comparing factories
In some cases you may want to compare the currently used factory with another factory. This can be useful if you are working with Eco Design, or if you're just unsure if you have selected the right factory for your product.

To compare factories, click the `Compare` button in the top right corner of the panel. This will open a side panel with a list of all the factories in your library.

Select the factory you want to compare with and click the `Add factory` button. This will show the selected factory properties in the sidepanel, and show its data in the impact graph at the bottom of the panel.

You can remove a factory from the comparison by clicking the `Remove` button above the top right corner of the factory properties.

To replace the currently added factory with one in the comparison, check the radio button next to its name, and then click the `Use selected` button in the top right corner of the sidepanel.

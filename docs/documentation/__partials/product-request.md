If your manufacturing process involves ordering components from a supplier connected to Eando X, you can import their component data to your library.
This has multiple benefits:

- You can get accurate LCA's without needing to request data from suppliers about their manufacturing processes.
- You can ensure that the manufacturing data for components is accurate and up to date.
- Over time, any changes to suppliers' manufacturing data will be automatically reflected in your products, eliminating the need for manual updates or frequent follow-ups.

If a supplier is not connected to Eando X, you can invite them and request the components you need.

# Library overview

One of the most powerful features in EandoX is the ability to use products from other companies as components in your own products.

These external products, called **Supplier products**, share their environmental impact data through EandoX. This keeps the supplier's manufacturing details private, while giving your products highly accurate (and easily maintainable) LCA reports.

When suppliers update their manufacturing process or supply chain, your products' LCA data automatically stays accurate without any need to check in with the supplier.

## Library pages

<!--@include: ../../documentation/__partials/library-vs-catalog.md -->

The library is split into two different pages:

### Global Library

The **Global Library** contains all publicly available supplier products. These can be added to your company library, and then be used in your products.

Products that you have created can be [shared](/documentation/product/sharing-a-product) to the **Global Library**, allowing other companies to use your products as supplier products.

### My Library

The **My Library** page lets you manage products and suppliers that you've added from the **Global library**.

You can also use this page to invite new suppliers to EandoX and request products that aren't yet available in the **Global library**.

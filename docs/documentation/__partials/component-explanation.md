A _component_ entity represents a reusable sub-assembly of a product (or another component). They can be created by you, or requested from your suppliers.

An example of a component is a **cushion**. This cushion could be used once in different models of an **armchair**, and/or multiple times in a **sofa**.

When you change the properties of a component, these changes will be reflected in all products that use this component.

# Product overview

In Eando X, everything revolves around the products you create. Every other entity you create will be connected to one or more products at some point.

:::tip
Entities are referring to the different types of data that you can create in Eando X. The entities are `Product`, `Component`, `Material`, `Packaging`, `Factory`, `Transport` and `Supplier`.

To get an overview of all the entities and how they relate to each other, you can read the [Workflow overview](/documentation/getting-started/workflow-overview).

## What is a product?

A product is the end result of your manufacturing process. You can see them as containers that hold all the supply chain data for one of your products. This data is used by Eando X to generate a LCA.

You can also use the products to generate EPD reports. Read more about EPD's Eando X [here](/documentation/epd/epd-overview).

## Requesting a product

If your manufacturing process involves ordering components from one or more suppliers, you can invite them to Eando X and request the components you need.

This has multiple benefits:

- You can get accurate LCU's without having to ask the suppliers for data on their manufacturing process.
- You can be sure that the data on the components manufacturing process is correct and up to date.
- Down the line, you won't have to contact the suppliers to see if their manufacturing process has changed. When they update their components, these changes will be automatically reflected in your products.

Read more about how to request a component [here](/documentation/supplier/creatinf-a-product-request).

## Product versioning

Product entities in Eando X can be versioned to allow for changes in your manufacturing process or supply chain.

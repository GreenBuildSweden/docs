In Eando X, the product component plays a fundamental role in the supply chain. Each product corresponds to a single SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) and consists of three meta value fields:

- **Name**: This field represents the name of the product that will be displayed to your customers. It helps identify and differentiate the product from others in your inventory.

- **Artnr**: The Artnr (article number) is a unique identifier assigned to the product. It serves as a reference number used by your customers to request information or inquire about the product.

- **Functional unit**: This field specifies the unit in which the product is sold. It provides information about the measurement or quantity associated with the product. More information about the functional unit can be found [here](link-to-functional-unit-docs).

These meta value fields associated with each product allow you to manage and track your inventory effectively, ensuring clear identification, easy referencing, and appropriate representation of products to your customers.

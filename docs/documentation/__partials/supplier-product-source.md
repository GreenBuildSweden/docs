The supplier products can have one of two types. The type determines where the data originates from:

- `Product`: This type indicates that the product data was entered into the system through EandoX.
- `EPD`: This type indicates that the product data was imported to the global library from a publicly available EPD, by the EandoX team.

There are several key differences between these types:

Since `EPD` products come from public databases that require third-party verification, they have strong industry credibility. When creating an EPD using the generator in EandoX, the use of `EPD` products streamlines the third-party verification process. Since these components have already been validated, the verifiers can focus on new elements specific to your product.

However, products with the `Product` type typically contains more detailed data, and could therefore lead to more accurate LCAs. This granularity may also give you more insight into the environmental impact of your product.

:::tip Importing EPD's
Users cannot import EPDs directly. If you have an EPD you'd like to add to EandoX, please contact us at [support@eandox.com](mailto:support@eandox.com?subject=EPD%20import%20request).

# Accessing supplier components

Before using a suppliers components in your products, you'll need to import the components to your library first. This extra step creates a personal collection of components you frequently use, making them easy to find instead of searching through thousands of options in EandoX.

Your library works across all your suppliers, so you can organize and access components from different sources in one place.

## Add products to your library

Navigate to the `Supplier` page in the left navigation menu. Then click the name of the supplier you want to import products from. This will take you to the products page for that supplier.

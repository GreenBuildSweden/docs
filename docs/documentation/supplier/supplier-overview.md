# Supplier overview

:::warning Are you a supplier?
This page is about managaing suppliers as an EandoX user. If you are a supplier looking for information, please refer to the [supplier quickstart](/documentation/getting-started/supplier-quickstart).
:::

Suppliers are an integral part of the EandoX workflow. They are the companies that manufacture the components you use in your products.

If your suppliers are part of EandoX, you can use their components in your products, and request components that are not in the library yet.

This allows you to get accurate LCA's without having to ask the suppliers for data on their manufacturing process. If a supplier updates their components, these changes will be automatically reflected in your products as well.

## Adding a supplier to your library

If you are new to EandoX, you might not have any suppliers in yor library yet. Read more about how to add a supplier that is already connected to EandoX [here](/documentation/supplier/adding-a-supplier).

## Inviting a supplier

If your supplier is not part of EandoX, you can send them an invite to the platform, along with a request for the components you need. Read more about it [here](/documentation/supplier/inviting-a-supplier).

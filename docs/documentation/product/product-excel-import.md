# Import products from Excel

EandoX allows you to import product data from spreadsheets, using the XLSX importer. It can also be used to update large amounts of product data quickly, by first [exporting your EandoX data](/documentation/product/product-excel-export), editing it in a spreadsheet editor, and then importing it back into EandoX.

:::tip Workflow tip
The simplest way to import data is by using a template sheet.

To create one, export an empty spreadsheet from EandoX. You can then edit it in any spreadsheet editor and import it back into EandoX when you're done.

Read more about exporting data [here](/documentation/product/product-excel-export).

## Importing products

Navigate to the `Products` page in the left navigation menu and click the `Import` button in the top right corner.

It has the following options:

| Field name                            | Field description                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Force autoshare setting**           | Check this if you want the imported products to automatically be shared with other companies in EandoX through the [Global Library](/documentation/library/library-overview). |
| **Auto publish updates after import** | Check this if you want the imported products to automatically be published after import.                                                                                      |
| **Pick file**                         | Selects the Excel file you want to import.                                                                                                                                    |

:::tip Autoshare vs Publish
Published products will not be visible in the **Global Library**, but can be shared with your subscribing companies if they send you a request.

Products that have the _autoshare_ setting enabled will be visible to all companies in EandoX when they search for products in the **Global Library**.

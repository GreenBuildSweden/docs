# Manage team

The people who are allowed to view and edit all of your internal data are called _team members_. They make up your Eando X team. Members can be added and removed from your team on the `Manage Team` page, found in the left navigation menu.

## Invite users

Navigate to the `Manage team` page in the left navigation menu. Click the `Invite new user` button to invite a new user.

This will open a sidepanel where you can enter the email address of the user you want to invite.

Clicking `Send invite` will send an email to the user with a link to accept the invitation.

You can see the status of the user in the list. If the user has not yet accepted the invitation, the status will be `Pending`.

Once they have accepted the invitation, the `Pending` status will be removed. This will allow them to log in to the system, and view and edit all of the internal data.

## Delete users

If you want to remove a user from your team, you can do so by selecting them in the list and clicking the `Delete user` button.

This will remove the user from the team, and they will no longer be able to log in to the system.

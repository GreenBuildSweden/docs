# Accessing supplier products

Before using a _supplier product_ in your own products, you'll need to import the _supplier product_ to your library first. This extra step creates a personal collection of components you frequently use, making them easy to find instead of searching through thousands of options in EandoX.

Your library works across all your suppliers, so you can organize and access components from different sources in one place.

## Add supplier products to your library

Navigate to the `Global library` page in the left navigation menu. This will take you to the page that lists all publicly available products in EandoX.

The fields in the list are as follows:

| Field name         | Field description                                                                                                                                              |

At the top of each column you can find input fields that helps you search for the supplier product you are looking for.

To add a supplier product to your library, hover the product item in the list. A checkbox will appear next to the product name. Check the checkbox, then click the `+ Add products to library` button in the top right corner of the page:

![Add products to library button FIXME](/images/placeholder.png)

Multiple products can be added at the same time.

:::warning No checkbox?
If you can't find a checkbox next to a product name, it means that the product has already been added to your library.

### What happens next?

When a supplier product has been added to your library it will show up on the `My Library` page. You will also be subscribed to the supplier that manufactures the product (if you are not already subscribed to them).

## Inspecting a supplier product before adding it to your library

Clicking the name of a supplier product will open a sidepanel that shows more detailed information about the product, its environmental impact, and material content.

![Supplier product sidepanel FIXME](/images/placeholder.png)

If the supplier product is already in your library, it will have the text `(in library)` after its name in the sidepanel header.

If the supplier product is not yet in your library, you can add it by clicking the `Add to library` button in the top right corner of the sidepanel.

If your manufacturing process involves ordering components from one or more suppliers, you can invite them to Eando X and request the components you use in your own manufacturing process.

This has multiple benefits:

- You can get accurate LCU's without having to ask the suppliers for data on their manufacturing process.
- You can be sure that the data on the components manufacturing process is correct and up to date.
- Down the line, you won't have to contact the suppliers to see if their manufacturing process has changed. When they update their components, these changes will be automatically reflected in your products.

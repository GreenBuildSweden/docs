A supplier product's data can come from one of two sources: either directly from suppliers using EandoX, or from publicly available EPDs imported by our team. This source is shown in the `type` field:

- `Product`: This type indicates that the product data was entered into the system by the supplier through EandoX.
- `EPD`: This type indicates that the product data was imported to the global library from a publicly available EPD, by the EandoX team.

There are several key differences between these types:

`EPD` products come from third-party verified public databases, giving them strong industry credibility. When you create an EPD in EandoX, using these pre-validated components speeds up verification since reviewers only need to focus on your product's unique elements.

However, products with the `Product` type typically contains more detailed data, and could therefore lead to more accurate LCAs. This granularity may also give you more insight into the environmental impact of your product.

:::tip Importing EPD's
EPDs can only be imported by the EandoX team. If you have an EPD you'd like to have available in the Global Library, please contact us at [support@eandox.com](mailto:support@eandox.com?subject=EPD%20import%20request).

The fields in the modal window are as follows:

| Field name     | Field description                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**       | The name of the custom field. This will also be used as its identifier, so make sure it's unique. |
| **Type**       | The data type of the custom field.                                                                |
| **Searchable** | Whether the value in the custom field should be used in the search results in the product list.   |

Click the `Create` button to create the custom field. You will now be able to add data to the custom field for every product.

# Inviting a supplier

If you can't find the supplier you're looking for when [adding a suppplier to your library](/documentation/supplier/adding-a-supplier), they are probably not part of Eando X yet. You can send them an invitation to join the platform.

Navigate to the `Suppliers` page and click the `Add supplier` button.

This will open a modal window where you can search for a supplier by name or organization number.

Misspelling happens more often than you think. Make sure to check your spelling, and try searching on both the name and organization number of the supplier before sending them an invitation.

If you can't find the supplier you're looking for, click the `Invite new supplier` button in the top right corner. This will open a modal window where you can enter the details of the supplier you want to invite, along with a message to send them.

# Component overview

A component is a reusable sub-assembly of a product. It is nearly identical to a product, but is designed specifically to be reused in other products. If you manufacture a product that only exists as a part of a larger product, it should probably be a component. An example of this is a **seat** that is part of multiple different **chairs**, but never sold separately.

## Benefits of using components

The biggest benefit of using components is that they can be reused in other products. In the **chair** example above, one change to a **seat** would update the LCA for all the **chairs** that use it.

## Component versioning

Component entities in Eando X can be versioned to allow for changes in your manufacturing process or supply chain.

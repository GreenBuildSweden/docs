# Accessing supplier products

To be able to use the products from a supplier in your own products, you need to add the suppliers products to your library first. This makes it easier to navigate the component list when creating your products, as you can have multiple suppliers in your library, and a single supplier can have hundreds of products available for you to choose from.

## Add products to your library

Navigate to the `Supplier` page in the left navigation menu. Then click the name of the supplier you want to import products from. This will take you to the products page for that supplier.

## See products in your library

In the **Supplier products** section, click the `Products added to my library` tab. This will show you all the products that you have added to your library.

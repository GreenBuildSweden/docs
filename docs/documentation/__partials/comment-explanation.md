In Eando X, you can attach comments to entities. Comments are used to share information within your team. Some common use cases are tracking progress, documenting processes, or ensuring that important details aren’t forgotten.

:::tip For internal use only
Comments will not appear in reports or affect calculations. This makes them ideal for team communication and organization.

## What entity owns the comment?

Comments are attached to specific entities within other entities, such as a _material_ added to a _product_.

It’s important to understand that comments are not global. While a comment might be attached to the _material_, it is tied to the specific _product_ where it was added. This means the comment will only be visible within that _product_, even if the _material_ is used in other _products_.

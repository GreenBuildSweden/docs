# Sharing a product

The products you create in Eando X are private by default. This means that they can only be seen by the people in your team. However, products can be shared with other Eando X companies if you choose to do so.

## When should I share a product?

Sharing is helpful if you're a supplier to a company that uses your products in their own manufacturing. They can access your product's LCA results without needing to view any of your manufacturing data. Whenever you update a shared product, their product LCAs will automatically update as well.

## Types of sharing

There are two types of shared products:

- **Limited sharing**: These products are only visible to the Eando X users you manually specify.
- **Full sharing**: These products are visible to all Eando X users, and can be browsed and searched for as soon as a user has added your company to their library of suppliers.

::: warning Don't forget to publish
To be able to share a product, it first needs to be published.

You can find the `Publish` button in the top right corner of the product page.

## Limited sharing

In order to share a product with individual companies only, they first need to send you a product request.

::: tip Requesting products
To learn more about how to request a product, read the [product request guide](/documentation/supplier/creating-a-product-request).
:::

When a product request has been sent, you will receive an email. You will also see a notification on the top of every page:

Clicking the notification will open a sidepanel where you can see all your received product requests.

This table contains the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Company** | The company that sent the product request. |
| **Name** | The name of the requested product. |
| **Article Number** | The article number of the requested product. |
| **Has Matching Art no.** | Whether the user provided an article number that matches one of your Eando X products. |
| **Request Date** | The date the product request was sent. |

::: danger Check the article number
The article number provided by the requesting company may not always match the one in your product catalog. This could happen due to reasons like miscommunication, missing information, or typing errors.

Make sure to check the article number for potential user error.
:::

### Matching article number

Check the `Has Matching Art no.` column to see if the article number provided by the requesting company matches one of your products. If it does, you can select the request (by ticking the checkbox next to the name), and click the `Fulfill with matching art no.` button in the top right corner.

This will share the product with the company, and close the sidepanel.

::: tip More than one request?
If you have multiple product requests with matching article numbers, you can tick multiple checkboxes at once.
:::

### No matching article number

If the article number provided by the requesting company does not match the product they requested, you can select the request (by ticking the checkbox next to the name), and click the `Fulfill with non-matching art no.` button in the top right corner.

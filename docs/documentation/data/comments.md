# Comments

In Eando X, you can attach comments to entities, allowing you to share information within your team. Comments can be used to track progress, document processes, or ensure important details aren’t forgotten, among other uses.

:::tip For internal use only
Comments won’t appear in reports or affect calculations. This makes them ideal for team communication and organization.

## What entity owns the comment?

Comments are attached to specific entities within other entities, such as a _material_ added to a _Product_.

It’s important to understand that comments are not global. While a comment might be attached to the _material_, it is tied to the specific _Product_ where it was added. This means the comment will only be visible within that _Product_, even if the _material_ is used in other _Products_.

## Adding comments

Click the `Edit` button of the entity you want to add a comment to.

## See all comments

You can view all comments attached to the added entities by clicking the `See all comments` button in `Edit` dropdown at the top of the entity page.

This will open a sidepanel displaying all entered comments. It will show the comment, the author, the date it was written, and the entity it is attached to.

Clicking on the name of the entity will open its sidepanel, and show you more details.

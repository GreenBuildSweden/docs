# Factory overview

Factories are where your product is made. It is not uncommon for a product to be manufactured and assembled in multiple factories.

## Default factory data

If you don't have any data from your factories, Eando X will use generic factory data for your products. It is however recommended that you enter data on your factories to get accurate LCA reports.

:::tip Waiting for data from the factory?

You can create a factory, but enter its data later. This is useful if you don't have the data yet, but want to start creating products.

When you update the factory data it will be updated in all the products that use it.

# EPD overview

EandoX features a powerful EPD generator that allows you to create reports on your products with ease.

## What is an EPD?

EPD stands for Environmental Product Declaration. It is a standardized report on the environmental impact of a product over its lifetime.

It is a great tool that allows companies to get a better understanding of their environmental impact, and to make more sustainable choices.

A comprehensible EPD allows your customers to get a good overview of your products. In many cases this can be what that makes or breaks a purchase.

## EPD versioning

Products and their manufacturing process change over time. Because of this, EandoX supports versioning of EPDs.

This helps you to keep a record of older versions of your EPDs. It can also aid in comparing your products environmental performance over time.

# Packaging overview

Packaging is the material you use to package the product during shipment or storage, that is later discarded. The packaging can exist in multiple layers, e.g. a pallet (discarded by the retailer), containing products in boxes (discarded by the end customer).

## Default packaging data

If you don't specify any packaging data, Eando X will use generic packaging data for your product. It is however recommended that you enter data on packaging to get accurate LCA reports.

:::tip Waiting for data from the factory?

You can create a packaging, but enter its data later. This is useful if you don't have the data yet, but want to start creating products.

When you update the packaging entity, it's data will be updated in all the products that use it.

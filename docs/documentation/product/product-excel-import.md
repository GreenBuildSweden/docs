# Import products from Excel

If you have a lot of data that already exists in spreadsheets, you can import it into EandoX with the import feature.

:::tip Workflow tip
The easiest way to get a template sheet for your data is by generating an empty export spreadsheet in EandoX. You can then edit the file in your spreadsheet editor of choice, and import it back into EandoX when it's filled out.

## Importing products

Navigate to the `Products` page in the left navigation menu and click the `Import` button in the top right corner.

This will open a sidepanel where you can select the Excel file you want to import.

It has the following options:

| Field name                            | Field description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Force autoshare setting**           | Decides wether the imported products should be shared with other companies in EandoX.      |
| **Auto publish updates after import** | Decides wether the imported products should be published to the EandoX after import. |
| **Pick file**                         | Selects the Excel file you want to import.                                                     |

:::info Autoshare vs Publish
Products that have the _autoshare_ setting enabled will not be visible when other companies search for products in EandoX, but can be shared with them upon request.

Published products will be visible to all companies in EandoX when they search for products.

When the file is uploaded, click the `Validate` button in the top right corner of the sidepanel to check if the data is valid. This will bring up the validation view.

The first thing you will see is the **Rows to import** tab. It will show you the data that will be imported.

If your manufacturing process involves ordering components from one or more suppliers, you can invite them to Eando X, and request that they create the components you use.

This has multiple benefits:

- You can get accurate LCA's without needing to request data from suppliers about their manufacturing processes.
- You can ensure that the manufacturing data for components is accurate and up to date.
- Over time, any changes to suppliers' manufacturing data will be automatically reflected in your products, eliminating the need for manual updates or frequent follow-ups.

# Transport overview

Transports in EandoX represent the movement of your goods - from raw materials to finished products and waste - between locations like factories, suppliers, recycling facilities, and customers.

A transport entity contains data on the transport method, how much it can carry, and how items are packed. It is flexible and can be reused in multiple contexts, without being tied to a specific product, supplier, location, or travel distance.

This transport data, combined with your factory locations and those of your EandoX-connected suppliers, helps calculate your supply chain's environmental impact.

## Default transport data

While custom transport data will give you the most accurate LCAs, it's not necessary when starting out.

EandoX offers a wide range of high-quality default data, developed by our team to meet all regulatory standards. You can use this data until you're ready to add your own specific transport details.

:::warning Data quality
The default data is based on industry averages. It is not specific to your company, and may not reflect your actual transport data. For highly accurate LCAs, we recommend adding your own transports.

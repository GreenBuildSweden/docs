# Custom fields

Custom fields let you store extra product data outside of EandoX’s standard data set or LCA. These fields are often used for internal details like CPC codes, the name of the person who added the product to your library, or the supplier’s name (if they’re not connected to EandoX).

:::warning Adding data to custom fields
This page is about creating and managing the custom fields that will be available in your products.

If you want to add data to the custom fields of your products, you can read about it [here](/documentation/product/creating-a-product#custom-fields).

The fields in the sidepanel are as follows:

| Field name     | Field description                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**       | The name of the custom field. This will also be used as its identifier, so make sure it's unique. |
| **Type**       | The data type of the custom field.                                                                |
| **Searchable** | Whether the value in the custom field should be used in the search results in the product list.   |

Click the `Create` button to create the custom field. You will now be able to add data to the custom field for every product.

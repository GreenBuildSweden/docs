# Import products from Excel

If you have a lot of data that already exists in spreadsheets, you can import it into EandoX using the XLSX importer. It can also be used to update a lot of product data quickly, by first [exporting your EandoX data](/documentation/product/product-excel-export), editing it in a spreadsheet editor, and then importing it back into EandoX.

:::tip Workflow tip
The simplest way to import data is by using a template sheet.

To create one, export an empty spreadsheet from EandoX. You can then edit it in any spreadsheet editor and import it back into EandoX when you're done.

## Importing products

Navigate to the `Products` page in the left navigation menu and click the `Import` button in the top right corner.

This will open a sidepanel where you can select the Excel file you want to import.

It has the following options:

| Field name                            | Field description                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Force autoshare setting**           | Check this if you want the imported products to automatically be shared with other companies in EandoX. |
| **Auto publish updates after import** | Check this if you want the imported products to automatically be published after import.                |
| **Pick file**                         | Selects the Excel file you want to import.                                                              |

:::tip Autoshare vs Publish
Products that have the _autoshare_ setting enabled will not be visible when other companies search for products in EandoX, but can be shared with them upon request.

Published products will be visible to all companies (that have added you to their list of suppliers) in EandoX when they search for products.

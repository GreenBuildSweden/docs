# Library overview

One of the most powerful features of EandoX is the ability to use products from other companies as components in your own manufacturing chain.

These external products are called **Supplier products**, and their data calculations are directly shared through EandoX, giving your products accurate LCA reports without requiring access to sensitive manufacturing details.

Your products automatically update when suppliers modify their manufacturing process or supply chain, ensuring your LCA data stays accurate over time, without any manual intervention.

## Library pages

The library is split into two different pages:

### Global Library

The **Global Library** contains all publicly available supplier products that you can add to your own library and use in your products.

Products that you have created and marked with `Autoshare` will automatically be published to the **Global Library**, allowing other companies to use your products as supplier products.

### My Library

The **My Library** page is where you can manage the products and suppliers that where added from the **Global library**. Here, you can also invite suppliers that are not already part of EandoX, and request products from them that are not yet part of the **Global library**.

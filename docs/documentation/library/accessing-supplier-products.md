# Accessing supplier products

Before using a _supplier product_ in your own products, you'll need to import the _supplier product_ to your library first. This extra step creates a personal collection of components you frequently use, making them easy to find instead of searching through thousands of options in EandoX.

Your library works across all your suppliers, so you can organize and access components from different sources in one place.

## Add supplier products to your library

Supplier products can be added to your library in two ways:

- The `Global library` page, if you aren't subscribed to any supplier yet.
- The `Supplier` sidepanel, for a supplier you are subscribed to. This is found in the `Suppliers` tab on the `My Library` page.

### From the Global library

Navigate to the `Global library` page in the left navigation menu. This will take you to the page that lists all publicly available products in EandoX.

</div>

At the top of each column you can find input fields that helps you search for the supplier product you are looking for.

To add a supplier product to your library, hover the product item in the list. A checkbox will appear next to the product name. Check the checkbox, then click the `+ Add products to library` button in the top right corner of the page:

![Add products to library button](/images/library/selected-global-product.jpg)

Multiple products can be added at the same time.

:::warning No checkbox?
If you can't find a checkbox next to a product name, it means that the product has already been added to your library.

### From the Supplier sidepanel

Navigate to the `My library` page in the left navigation menu. This will take you to the page that lists all supplier products in your library. Click the `Suppliers` tab to see a list of all the suppliers you are subscribed to.

At the bottom of the sidepanel you can find a list of all the products that are available from the supplier. The fields are the same as in the `Global library` list (detailed [above](#supplier-product-table)), with the addition of the _In library_ column that shows if you've already added the supplier product to your library.

To add a supplier product to your library, check the checkbox next to its name. Then click the `+ Add to library`.

### What happens next?

When a supplier product has been added to your library it will show up on the `My Library` page. You will also be subscribed to the supplier that manufactures the product (if you are not already subscribed to them).

## Inspecting a supplier product before adding it to your library

Clicking the name of a supplier product will open a sidepanel that shows more detailed information about the product, its environmental impact, and material content.

![Supplier product sidepanel](/images/library/supplier-product-sidepanel.jpg)

If the supplier product is already in your library, it will have the text `(in library)` after its name in the sidepanel header.

If the supplier product is not yet in your library, you can add it by clicking the `Add to library` button in the top right corner of the sidepanel.

# Supplier overview

:::warning Are you a supplier?
This page is about managaing suppliers as an EandoX user. If you are a supplier looking for information, please refer to the [supplier quickstart](/documentation/getting-started/supplier-quickstart).
:::

A supplier is a company that manufactures and provides components that you use in your products. They are a crucial part of any manufacturing process, as they help create the building blocks of your final products.

In EandoX, suppliers can share their component data calculations directly with you through the platform. Once a supplier is connected to EandoX, you can access their component library, and request new components.

This gives you accurate LCA data without having to ask the supplier for sensitive manufacturing details. An added benefit is that your products stay up-to-date automatically when suppliers make changes to their components. This makes it easier to maintain accurate data over time.

## What entity owns the comment?

A comment is attached to a specific entities within another entity, like a _material_ added to a _product_.

Itâ€™s important to understand that comments are not global. While a comment might be attached to the _material_, it is tied to the specific _product_ where it was added. This means the comment will only be visible within that _product_, even if the _material_ is used in other _products_.

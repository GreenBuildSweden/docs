# Workflow overview

Eando X is designed to make it easy to maintain, inspect and update your products supply chain data.

In most manufacturing processes, you typically have at least one supplier from whom you order components. If you use supplier-sourced components in your products, you can either create all products and components yourself or invite your suppliers to join the Eando X. This will allow them to create and share the components you order from them. By requesting suppliers to create these components, you ensure that the data is accurate, and any updates they make to their manufacturing processes will automatically update in your products over time.

## Quick terminology

:::info Entity

An entity refers to the different types of data that you can create in Eando X. The entities are `Product`, `Component`, `Material`, `Packaging`, `Factory`, `Transport` and `Supplier`.
:::

:::info Product

A product is the end result of your manufacturing process. This is what you will be working with the most. All other entities are connected to one or multiple products.

An example of a product is an **armchair**.
:::

:::info Component

A component is a reusable sub-assembly of a product. When you change the properties of a component, these changes will be reflected in all products that use this component.

Components can be created by you, or requested from your suppliers.

An example of a component is a **cushion**. This cushion could be used once in different models of an **armchair**, and/or multiple times in a **sofa**.
:::

:::info Material

A material is the raw material that is used to create a product.

All data on materials is created by us using historical data from the industry. Missing materials can be requested from Eando X.

An example of a material is **cotton**.

:::

:::info Packaging

A packaging is all materials that are used to package a product.

An example of a packaging for an **armchair** could be **cardboard**, **plastic wrapping** and **pallet**.

:::

:::info Factory

A factory is the location where your product is manufactured, and what environmental impact the manufacturing process has.
:::

:::info Transport

A transport is the vehicle used to transport your product and/or its parts.

An example of a transport for an **armchair** could be **boat** and **truck**.
:::

:::info Supplier

A supplier is the company that manufactures components that are used in your products.

You can invite suppliers to create declarations of the products you order from them. Allowing suppliers to create their components themselves allows the data to be more correct and up to date. It removes the need for regular check-ins with suppliers and reduces the need for NDAs.

## Process

<!--
FIXME: Make this cleaner
-->

The most common workflow is as follows:

- Create a **product**.
- Attach all relevant entities to your **product**.
- If you're creating your first product you will need to create some of these entities, like **transport**, **packaging** and **factory**.
- Any reusable sub-assemblies should be created as **components**.
- Any components that you order from a supplier should be attached as **components**.
  - If your supplier is not yet connected to Eando X, you can invite them and ask them to create the products you need. In the meantime, you can create their components yourself and replace them with the supplier's components later on.
  - If your supplier is already connected to Eando X, you can add them to your supplier list. You can then find their products and add them as components to your **product**. If the product doesnâ€™t exist yet, you can request it from your supplier.

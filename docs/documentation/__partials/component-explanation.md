A _component_ entity represents a reusable sub-assembly of a product. When you change the properties of a component, these changes will be reflected in all products that use this component.

Components can be created by you, or requested from your suppliers.

An example of a component is a **cushion**. This cushion could be used once in different models of an **armchair**, and/or multiple times in a **sofa**.

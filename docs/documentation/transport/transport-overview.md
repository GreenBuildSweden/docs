# Transport overview

Transports are how your products, components, materials, and waste is moved between different locations. These locations can be your factories, your suppliers factories, different recycling facilities or your customers.

A transport entity contains data on the mode of transport, its capacity, and packing details. It is flexible and can be reused in multiple contexts, without being tied to a specific product, supplier, location, or travel distance.

This transport data, combined with your factory locations and those of your Eando X-connected suppliers, helps calculate your supply chain's environmental impact.

## Default transport data

Creating custom transports tailored to your specific supply chain is key to achieving a highly accurate LCA with a high data quality, but it's not necessary when starting out.

Eando X offers a wide range of high-quality default data, developed by our team to meet all regulatory standards. You can use this data as long as needed, though it may not be as precise as custom data.

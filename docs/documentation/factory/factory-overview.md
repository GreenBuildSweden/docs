# Factory overview

Factories are where your product is made. It is not uncommon for a product to be manufactured and assembled in multiple factories.

## Default factory data

Creating custom factories tailored to your specific supply chain is essential for achieving a highly accurate LCA with a high data quality, but it's not necessary when starting out.

Eando X provides offers a wide range of high-quality default data, developed by our team to meet all regulatory standards. You can use this data as long as needed, though it may not be as precise as custom data.

This factory data, and that of your Eando X-connected suppliers, helps calculate your supply chainâ€™s environmental impact.

:::tip Waiting for data from the factory?

You can create a factory and add its data later, which is helpful if you know the factories in your supply chain but don't yet have specific data for them.

Once the factory entity is updated, its data will automatically update in all the products the factory is used in.
